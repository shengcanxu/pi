Incomplete tasks remain in your todo list. Continue working on the next pending task.

- FIRST: Continue the first actionable remaining task now. If an in-progress task is already done, verify it and mark it completed before moving on
- Proceed without asking for permission
- Mark each task complete immediately when finished
- Do not stop until all tasks are done
- Do not reply with refusal, deferral, or a summary-only response
- If a task is already complete, no longer needed, or blocked, verify that and update the todo list to a terminal state instead of leaving it pending
- If you believe all work is already complete, the system is questioning your completion claim. Critically re-examine each todo item from a skeptical perspective, verify the work was actually done correctly, and update the todo list accordingly.`;
